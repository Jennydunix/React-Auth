# React Fake User Authentication using Context API hosted on the Vercel App. Link Below :point_down: :point_down: 
https://react-auth-jet.vercel.app/

For this project, I had to Setup react-router, implemented Nested routes, 404 page, and Error boundary.

I also had to set up fake userAuthContext using the context API to always carry out a fake authentication, 

Using the custom hook i extracted the username of the current logged in user. As well as Implemented SEO and Navigation menu that was perfectly displayed on each page.

The nested route page(check result page) serves as a test for Error Boundary.

The not found page(404 Page) also used for the forgot password on the login page is being displayed whenever the user navigates to an alien route ie a route that doesn't exist in our application. A button is being provided for the user to go back to the home page.
